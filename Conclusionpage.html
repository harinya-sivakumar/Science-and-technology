        * Science and technology has a profound impact on
        all of humanity’s activities.<BR>
<BR>
        Science and technology inventions and
        discoveries, including the theory of the origin of the
        universe, the theory of evolution, and the discovery
        of genes, have given humanity many hints relating
        to human existence from civilized and cultural
        points of view. Science and technology have had an
        immeasurable influence on the formation of our
        understanding of the world, our view of society, and
        our outlook on nature.<BR>
<BR>
        The wide variety of technologies and science
        discoveries produced by humanity has led to the
        building and development of the civilizations of
        each age, stimulated economic growth, raised
        people’s standards of living, encouraged cultural
        development, and had a tremendous impact on
        religion, thought, and many other human activities.
        The impact of science and technology on modern
        society is broad and wide-ranging, influencing such
        areas as politics, diplomacy, defense, the economy,
        medicine, transportation, agriculture, social capital
        improvement, and many more. The fruits of science
        and technology fill every corner of our lives.
        The hundred years of the twentieth century have
        been called the “century of science and
        technology,” the “century of war,” and the “century
        of human prosperity,” among other expressions.<BR>

        Science and technology have thus far brought
        humanity immeasurable benefits. In the twenty-first
        century, dubbed the “century of knowledge” and the
        time of a “knowledge-based society,” it is hoped
        that the diverse potentials of science and technology,
        built upon the foundation of the hard-won science
        and technology of the twentieth century, will be
        used to solve the serious issues faced by humanity,
        such as global environmental problems. Moreover,
        it is also important to hold the firm belief that
        science and technology must be faithfully passed on
        to future generations as an irreplaceable asset of
        humanity, driven by the trust and support of the
        public.<BR> <BR>

        Science and technology will most likely continue
        to be regarded by humanity as an invaluable
        commodity. However, the relationship between
        science and technology and society is assuming
        many shapes with the changing times. Against the
        backdrop of the historical turnaround in the world
        order that came with the collapse of the U.S.-Soviet
        cold war structure, and with accelerating scientific
        and technological progress, as exemplified by the
        life sciences and IT, it is no exaggeration to say that
        society is transforming abruptly and daily becoming
        more complex. This transformation appears in
        public opinion polls as changes in public awareness
        of science and technology and heightened public
        concern over the safety and security of society.<BR>
<H1 align="center"><img src="Scienceandtech.jpg"></H1>
            <BR>
        In the present, squarely addressing the
        relationship between science and technology and
        society is an essential challenge to the sound
        development of science and technology, one which
        it is important to continue addressing in the future
        based on historical and civilized perspectives, while
        also maintaining a deep awareness of the needs of
        the times.<BR>

    Sustainable development is widely recognized as an existential challenge. To address it, humanity needs to change its ways. However, people seem slow to act, not always understanding and often denying environmental imperatives, creating substantial social and psychological barriers. Social inertia and denial have been allegedly amplified by a public discourse increasingly distrustful of science. But is this discourse a rejection of science or an erosion of trust in how science is applied? The paper examines the main differences between environmental science and technology, reviews how the wider science-technology convergence has affected them and evaluates potential implications for sustainability challenges. <BR> <BR> We question whether the “convergence” between environmental science and technology, could be behind the growing public dissatisfaction and distrust of environmental science and policies. Although environmental science plays a role in enabling understanding and communicating complexity, technology requires political, social and economic skills, beyond conventional disciplinary expertise. To avoid putting academic freedom at risk, environmental technologists, a new breed of professionals, should have a clear understanding of scientific capacity and uncertainty and be able to engage with stakeholders, policy makers and the public to design integrated, interdisciplinary and holistic solutions, and also better define the many environmental problems we face.
